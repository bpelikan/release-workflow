Now that your release is finalized, we have a confession to make... somewhere in our recent update, I made a mistake and introduced a bug. Instead of changing the text colors to green, we changed the whole background.

_Sometimes GitHub Pages takes a few minutes to update. Your page might not immediately show the recent updates you've made._

"Hotfixes", or a quick fix to address a bug in software, are a normal part of development. Oftentimes you'll see application updates whose only description is "bug fixes".

When bugs come up after you release a version, you'll need to address them.

We've already created this branch, pull request, and suggested a fix. The suggested change will be merged into the main branch. Later we will `cherry-pick` the hotfix commits into the release branch.
