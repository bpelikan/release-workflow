## Step 13: Approve the backport pull request

If you have previous release branches that are impacted by this bug, you might need to make a few retroactive pull requests. Generally, we do this by using [`git cherry-pick`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick) to apply just those commits that should be backported.

In our case, no new changes have been merged into main since we shipped our hotfix, so we can merge the entire branch as is.
