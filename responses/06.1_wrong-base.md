Uh oh, the branches in this pull request aren't quite right.

### :keyboard: Activity: Fix the base

I was expecting `base:` set to `main`, and `compare:` set to `release-v1.0`.

- To change just your base, see [Changing the base branch of a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request/) for full instructions. 
- To change the `compare:` branch, close this pull request and open a new one with `base:` set to `main` and `compare:` set to `release-v1.0`.

<h3 align="center">I'll respond in this pull request when you've changed the base, or in your new pull request if you close this one out.</h3>
